# Recommendation System (Simplified Version)

This repository is a **simplified analogue** of a real recommendation system project. It serves to demonstrate the technologies and methodologies used in building recommendation systems. The full project contains more features and complexity, but this version showcases the core concepts and tools used in the process.

## Project Overview

This repository implements a basic recommendation system using the following technologies:

- **Data Processing**: Preprocessing of datasets.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Basic recommendation algorithms (e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based).
- **Backend**: Python scripts to execute and test the recommendation algorithms.
  
The full version of this project (not available in this repository) includes additional features such as a user interface, more advanced models, scalability improvements, and integration with databases for storing user preferences.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

Clone this simplified version of the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/goodiee/recommendation-system.git
cd recommendation-system
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Recommendation System
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the recommendation system. Typically, you would run the following:

```
python search.py
```
This will execute the recommendation logic and display the results based on the dataset used.

4. Modify the Data (Optional)
You can modify the dataset (usually found in data/ folder or within specific CSV files) to experiment with different input data for generating recommendations.
