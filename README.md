# Recommendation System (Simplified Version)

This repository is a **simplified analogue** of a real recommendation system project. It serves to demonstrate the technologies and methodologies used in building recommendation systems. The full project contains more features and complexity, but this version showcases the core concepts and tools used in the process.

## Project Overview

This repository implements a basic recommendation system using the following technologies:

- **Data Processing**: Preprocessing of datasets.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Basic recommendation algorithms (e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based).
- **Backend**: Python scripts to execute and test the recommendation algorithms.
  
The full version of this project (not available in this repository) includes additional features such as a user interface, more advanced models, scalability improvements, and integration with databases for storing user preferences.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

Clone this simplified version of the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/goodiee/recommendation-system.git
cd recommendation-system


2. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Recommendation System
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the recommendation system. Typically, you would run the following:

bash
Copy
Edit
python recommend.py
This will execute the recommendation logic and display the results based on the dataset used.

4. Modify the Data (Optional)
You can modify the dataset (usually found in data/ folder or within specific CSV files) to experiment with different input data for generating recommendations.

Key Technologies Used
Python

Pandas (for data manipulation)

Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)

Flask or similar backend framework (if applicable)

Other libraries for data visualization or recommendation techniques (e.g., numpy, matplotlib)

Example Usage
Running the Recommendation System:

bash
Copy
Edit
python recommend.py
This will generate recommendations based on the input data.

Changing the Dataset:

If you'd like to modify the dataset, look for files in the data/ directory (or similar) where you can input new data or adjust existing entries.

Notes
This repository is a simplified version for educational purposes, showcasing the basic technologies used in recommendation systems.

The full, real-world project (which includes more advanced features) is not part of this repository but is built using the same principles.

Dependencies
numpy

pandas

scikit-learn

flask (if used for backend)

Install the dependencies using:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
